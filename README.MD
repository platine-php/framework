### Requirements 
You can use **Platine Framework** for web or command line application. For web application: 
- Any web server **(Apache, nginx, lighttp, etc.)**
- **PHP >= 7.4**, **PHP 8** 

For CLI application just PHP executable is enough. 

### Why another PHP Framework?
Well, I created Platine Framework for my own project, but decided to share with everyone.  
I was also tired of all those bloated PHP Framework, with steep learning curve that create another language on top of PHP. Really?!  
So this one is smaller. It is not bloated and contains some useful libraries, functions and tricks. And above all, it's damn simple.

### Installation
Platine Framework can be installed using composer
```bash
composer require platine-php/framework
```
